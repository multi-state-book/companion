# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is the companion website to our book published by Chapman & Hall (link).

R code for the analyses and plots presented in the book is given, except for analyses on the LEADER data. SAS code is available for the analyses only.

Solutions to the exercises in the book are available at the end of each chapter.

The code is neither optimized nor prettified but we hope you will find them helpful anyway. 

This companion was created with R version ..., Rstudio version ..., Quarto version ..., and SAS version ...

## Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

Sincerely thanks to Julie K. Furberg who carefully created figures and validated analyses quoted in the book. Eva N.S. Wandall thoroughly created solutions to practical exercises and contributed to some of the examples.
