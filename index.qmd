This is the code companion website to our book published by [Chapman & Hall](https://doi.org/10.1201/9780429029684 "see the book at the publisher"){target="_blank"}.

R code with output for analyses and plots presented in the book is provided. Corresponding code in SAS with no output is given. Solutions to the exercises are available at the end of each chapter.

Please note:

-   A few places R or SAS code is not available (NA) and is denoted 'R-NA' and 'SAS-NA', respectively.
-   Code often depends on previous code in the same chapter including loading of required R packages.
-   R and SAS will not necessarily give exactly the same answers. For a comparison of `coxph` and SAS `phreg` see [coxph vs. SAS phreg](https://github.com/therneau/survival/blob/master/vignette2/sas.pdf){target="_blank"}.
-   When using bootstrap and other re-sampling techniques, small deviations from the book will occur as no fixed seeds have been used.
-   R solutions to the exercises are also available as Quarto files (`.qmd`) in the R folder on [github](https://github.com/multi-state-book/companion){target="_blank"}. SAS solutions are  available as `.sas` files, see the exercises in the individual chapters.
-   Versions R-4.3.1 and SAS/STAT 15.1 were used.
-   We welcome suggested improvements of the code. Please use the 'Report an issue' facility below Table of contents.

A chapter with errata is also provided.
