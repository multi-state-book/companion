This is the code companion website to our book published by [Chapman & Hall](https://www.routledge.com/Models-for-Multi-State-Survival-Data-Rates-Risks-and-Pseudo-Values/Andersen-Ravn/p/book/9780367140021# "go to the book at the publisher").

R and SAS code for analyses and plots presented in the book is provided. In some situations only R code is given. When using bootstrap small deviations from the one in the book may occur as no fixed seeds are given. Solutions to the exercises in the book are available for each chapter.

This code and output was created using R version 4.3.1 and SAS/Stat version 15.1.
